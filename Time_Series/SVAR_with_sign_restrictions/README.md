  - <sub> Dataset **sw2001.txt** contains quarterly data on the US economy 1960Q1-2000Q4 for inflation, the unemployment rate, and the federal funds rate, as used by Stock and Watson (2001). It serves well the purpose of illustration.</sub>  
    - <sub> The shock of interest is a monetary policy shock. I assume a negative response of inflation and positive response of the interest rate, while I do not impose any restrictions on the response of the unemployment rate. Restrictions apply from quarter 1 through 6.</sub>
