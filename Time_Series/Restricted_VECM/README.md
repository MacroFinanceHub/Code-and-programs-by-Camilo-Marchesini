## Restricted\_VECM : The expectations theory of the term structure of the interest rate.

  - <sub>R script **restricted\_VECM.R** offers an example of how to test for cointegration using a restricted VECM approach. Are the Swedish STIBOR and the 10-year Swedish government bonds cointegrated series? I use Johansen's maximum likelihood-based procedure to test whether the spread between the two is stationary by imposing restrictions on the coefficients of the VECM representation and conducting inference of these restrictions.</sub>  
- <sub> Dataset **cointegration.txt** contains data on Swedish STIBOR and the 10-year Swedish government bonds, downloaded from the [Swedish Central Bank](https://www.riksbank.se/en-gb/statistics/).</sub>
